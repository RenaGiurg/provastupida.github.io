    <h1> WELCOME!</h1>
        <h2> What is this?</h2>
            <p> This is a test I am making to make a kind of blog and to practice a bit with silly stuff such as HTML and in the future CSS and JS. Is there a particular reason as to why I am doing this? No not really</p>
        <h2> What will I find in this website?</h2>
            <p> As of now? Likely nothing especially because I have no idea on how to build a website. In the future I may update it with some stuff, much like a blog.</p>
        <h2> Why do I have access to this? And who else does?</h2>
            <p> If you have access to this you are likely a friend or a friend of a friend because I did not make the link to this page public,lmao.
         <br> <br> In any case, welcome to my small angle of peace and quiet!
         <br> Moreover at the moment it's just Pupino that has access to it :3 </p>
