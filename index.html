    <h1> WELCOME!</h1>
        <h2> What is this?</h2>
            <p> This is a test I am making to practice a bit with silly stuff such as HTML and maybe CSS and JS. Is there a particular reason as to why I am doing this? No not really but maybe I'll put my uni notes in here just for fun.</p>
        <h2> What will I find in this website?</h2>
            <p> As of now? Likely nothing especially because I have no idea on how to build a website.</p>
        <h2> Why do I have access to this? And who else does?</h2>
            <p> If you have access to this you are likely a friend or someone who found it for some reason. I got to publish it if I want to make it viewable on github apparently so if someone ended up here by mistake... Hi I guess?
         <br> <br> In any case, welcome to my small angle of peace and quiet!</p>
